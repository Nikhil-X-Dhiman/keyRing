## 1. Rate Limiting

### What is Rate Limiting and Why is it Important?

Rate limiting is a technique to control the amount of incoming traffic to your server. It restricts the number of requests a user can make to your API in a given amount of time. This is a crucial security measure to prevent various types of attacks, the most common being **brute-force attacks**. In a brute-force attack, an attacker tries to guess a user's password by repeatedly trying different combinations. By limiting the number of login attempts, you can significantly slow down and deter such attacks.

### How it Works (The Data Flow)

1.  **Request Received:** A user makes a request to one of your API endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/auth/login`).
2.  **IP Address Identified:** The rate-limiting middleware identifies the user by their IP address.
3.  **Request Count Checked:** The middleware checks how many requests this IP address has made in a specific time window.
4.  **Decision Made:**
    *   If the number of requests is below the limit, the request is allowed to proceed to your controller.
    *   If the number of requests exceeds the limit, the middleware blocks the request and sends a `429 Too Many Requests` error response.

### Implementation with `express-rate-limit`

`express-rate-limit` is a popular and easy-to-use middleware for implementing rate limiting in Express applications.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install express-rate-limit
```

**General Rate Limiter (in `server.js`):**

This limiter will apply to all routes in your application.

```javascript
import rateLimit from "express-rate-limit";

// ...

const limiter = rateLimit({
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
    standardHeaders: true,
    legacyHeaders: false,
});

server.use(limiter);
```

**Specific Rate Limiter for Login (in `routes/auth.routes.js`):**

For sensitive endpoints like login, it's a good practice to have a stricter rate limit.

```javascript
import rateLimit from "express-rate-limit";

const loginLimiter = rateLimit({
    windowMs: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
    max: 5,
    message: "Too many login attempts from this IP, please try again after 10 minutes",
    standardHeaders: true,
    legacyHeaders: false,
});

router.route("/login").post(loginLimiter, handleLogin);
```

## 2. Input Validation with Zod

### What is Input Validation and Why is it Important?

Input validation is the process of ensuring that the data received from the client is in the correct format and meets certain criteria. This is a critical security measure to prevent various attacks, such as:

*   **SQL Injection:** Where an attacker injects malicious SQL code into your database queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Where an attacker injects malicious scripts into your website.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Where an attacker sends a large amount of invalid data to crash your server.

### How it Works (The Data Flow)

1.  **Request Received:** A user makes a request with a payload (e.g., a JSON body).
2.  **Validation Middleware:** Before the request reaches your controller, a validation middleware intercepts it.
3.  **Schema Check:** The middleware uses a predefined schema (a set of rules) to check if the data in the request is valid.
4.  **Decision Made:**
    *   If the data is valid, the request is passed on to the next middleware or the controller.
    *   If the data is invalid, the middleware immediately sends a `400 Bad Request` error response with details about the validation errors.

### Implementation with Zod

Zod is a powerful and easy-to-use library for data validation.

**Validation Middleware (`middlewares/validation.middleware.js`):**

This middleware is a generic function that can be used with any Zod schema.

```javascript
export const validate = (schema) => (req, res, next) => {
    try {
        schema.parse({ body: req.body, query: req.query, params: req.params });
        next();
    } catch (err) {
        return res.status(400).send(err.errors);
    }
};
```

**Validation Schemas (`utils/validationSchemas.js`):**

Here you define the rules for your data.

```javascript
import { z } from "zod";

export const loginSchema = z.object({
    body: z.object({
        email: z.string().email(),
        password: z.string().min(8),
    }),
});
```

**Using the Middleware (`routes/auth.routes.js`):**

```javascript
import { validate } from "../middlewares/validation.middleware.js";
import { loginSchema } from "../utils/validationSchemas.js";

router.route("/login").post(validate(loginSchema), handleLogin);
```

## 3. Centralized Error Handling

### What is Centralized Error Handling and Why is it Important?

Centralized error handling is a technique to manage all your application's errors in one place. Instead of having `try...catch` blocks scattered throughout your code, you have a single middleware that catches all errors and sends a consistent and informative response to the client.

This approach has several benefits:

*   **Cleaner Code:** It keeps your controllers and services clean and focused on their primary logic.
*   **Consistent Error Responses:** It ensures that all your error responses have the same format.
*   **Easier Debugging:** It provides a single place to log and debug errors.

### How it Works (The Data Flow)

1.  **Error Thrown:** An error occurs in one of your controllers, services, or middlewares.
2.  **Error Passed to `next()`:** Instead of handling the error directly, you pass it to the `next()` function (e.g., `next(error)`).
3.  **Error Handling Middleware:** Express automatically forwards the error to your centralized error handling middleware.
4.  **Error Response Sent:** The middleware processes the error and sends a formatted error response to the client.

### Implementation

**Custom Error Class (`errors/customError.js`):**

This class allows you to create custom errors with specific status codes.

```javascript
class AppError extends Error {
    constructor(message, statusCode) {
        super(message);
        this.statusCode = statusCode;
        this.status = `${statusCode}`.startsWith("4") ? "fail" : "error";
        this.isOperational = true;
        Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor);
    }
}

export default AppError;
```

**Error Handling Middleware (`middlewares/error.middleware.js`):**

This middleware will catch all errors and send a formatted response.

```javascript
const handleErrors = (err, req, res, next) => {
    err.statusCode = err.statusCode || 500;
    err.status = err.status || "error";

    res.status(err.statusCode).json({
        status: err.status,
        message: err.message,
    });
};

export default handleErrors;
```

**Using the Middleware (in `server.js`):**

```javascript
import handleErrors from "./middlewares/error.middleware.js";

// ...

server.use(handleErrors);
```

## 4. Unit Testing

### What is Unit Testing and Why is it Important?

Unit testing is a software testing method where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It often has one or a few inputs and a single output.

Benefits of unit testing:

*   **Improves Code Quality:** It forces you to write better, more modular code.
*   **Catches Bugs Early:** It helps you find and fix bugs early in the development process.
*   **Provides a Safety Net:** It gives you the confidence to refactor and add new features without breaking existing functionality.

### How it Works (The Data Flow)

1.  **Test Runner:** A test runner (like Jest) executes your test files.
2.  **Test Environment:** The test runner sets up a test environment, which may include a mock database or a mock server.
3.  **Test Execution:** The test runner executes the code in your test files, which makes requests to your application's code.
4.  **Assertions:** You use assertions to check if the actual output of your code matches the expected output.
5.  **Test Results:** The test runner reports the results of your tests (pass or fail).

### Implementation with Jest and Supertest

*   **Jest:** A popular JavaScript testing framework.
*   **Supertest:** A library for testing Node.js HTTP servers.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest supertest
```

**Test File (`__tests__/auth.test.js`):**

```javascript
import request from "supertest";
import express from "express";
import { authRouter } from "../routes/auth.routes.js";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use("/api/v1/auth", authRouter);

describe("Auth Routes", () => {
    it("should return 400 if email or password are not provided for login", async () => {
        const res = await request(app).post("/api/v1/auth/login").send({});
        expect(res.statusCode).toEqual(400);
    });
});
```

## 5. Containerization with Docker

### What is Containerization and Why is it Important?

Containerization is a lightweight alternative to full machine virtualization that involves encapsulating an application in a container with its own operating environment. This allows you to run your application in any environment without worrying about dependencies or configuration issues.

Benefits of containerization:

*   **Portability:** Your application will run the same way on any machine.
*   **Scalability:** You can easily scale your application by running multiple instances of your container.
*   **Isolation:** Your application is isolated from other applications on the same machine.

### How it Works (The Data Flow)

1.  **Dockerfile:** You create a `Dockerfile` that contains instructions for building a Docker image.
2.  **Docker Image:** You use the `Dockerfile` to build a Docker image, which is a snapshot of your application and its environment.
3.  **Docker Container:** You run the Docker image to create a Docker container, which is a running instance of your application.
4.  **Docker Compose:** You can use `docker-compose` to manage multiple containers at once.

### Implementation

**`Dockerfile` for Client:**

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:stable-alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

**`Dockerfile` for Server:**

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "run", "pro"]
```

**`docker-compose.yml`:**

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  client:
    build: ./client
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  server:
    build: ./server
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

## 6. CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

### What is CI/CD and Why is it Important?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment. It's a practice that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying your application.

*   **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically building and testing your code every time you push a change to your repository.
*   **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Automatically deploying your application to a staging or production environment after it passes all the tests.

Benefits of CI/CD:

*   **Faster Release Cycles:** You can release new features and bug fixes to your users more quickly.
*   **Improved Code Quality:** It helps you catch bugs early and ensures that your code is always in a deployable state.
*   **Reduced Risk:** It reduces the risk of human error in the deployment process.

### How it Works (The Data Flow)

1.  **Code Push:** You push a change to your GitHub repository.
2.  **Workflow Triggered:** GitHub Actions automatically triggers a workflow.
3.  **Job Execution:** The workflow runs a series of jobs, such as building your application, running tests, and deploying to a server.
4.  **Feedback:** You get feedback on the status of your build and deployment.

### Implementation with GitHub Actions

**`.github/workflows/main.yml`:**

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Use Node.js 18.x
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: 18.x

    - name: Install dependencies and test server
      run: |
        cd server
        npm install
        npm test

    - name: Install dependencies and build client
      run: |
        cd client
        npm install
        npm run build
```
